Instead, our research aims to develop robots that can be programmed by its end-users in their context of use, so that the robot needs to robustly function in only one particular environment. This requires intuitive ways in which end-users can program their robot. To that end, this paper contributes a flow-based visual programming language, called RoboFlow, that allows programming of generalizable mobile manipulation tasks. RoboFlow is designed to (i) ensure a robust low-level implementation of program procedures on a mobile manipulator, and (ii) restrict the high-level programming as much as possible to avoid user errors while enabling expressive programs that involve branching, looping, and nesting. We present an implementation of RoboFlow on a PR2 mobile manipulator and demonstrate the generalizability and error handling properties of RoboFlow programs on everyday mobile manipulation tasks in human environments."},{"rank":2,"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","article_number":"7139972","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139972","title":"Learning non-holonomic object models for mobile manipulation","publication_number":7128761,"publication_title":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","isbn":"New-2005_Electronic_978-1-4799-6923-4","issn":"1050-4729","publisher":"IEEE","citing_paper_count":1,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Friction","Manipulators","Mobile robots","Robot sensing systems","Trajectory","Wheels"]}},"pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7139972","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7139972","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=7139972","authors":{"authors":[{"full_name":"Jonathan Scholz","affiliation":"Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, 30332, USA","author_order":1},{"full_name":"Martin Levihn","affiliation":"Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, 30332, USA","author_order":2},{"full_name":"Charles L.

It is very important for a planner to identify narrow passages in real time and boost valid points within them effectively. A novel narrow passage predictive model for designing a path planner in changing environments is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an Expanded Dynamic Bridge Builder is presented to identify narrow passages rapidly with validity-toggle sampling points in C-space. Secondly, the predictive model is adopted to sample possibly free points within these narrow passages without invoking any collision detection in order to avoid intense computational complexity. The predictive model is obtained by the famous classification method of Support Vector Machine (SVM). A new feature, which includes a group of points' distance and validity information, is proposed in SVM training process to capture approximate structure of local narrow passages. Therefore, the predictive model can excavate the hidden similar structure of local narrow passages. Experiments carried out with two 6-DOFs manipulators show that our approach gain higher success rate of planning and time efficiency than other related methods."},{"rank":5,"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","article_number":"7139970","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139970","title":"Decentralized parameter estimation and observation for cooperative mobile manipulation of an unknown load using noisy measurements","publication_number":7128761,"publication_title":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","isbn":"New-2005_Electronic_978-1-4799-6923-4","issn":"1050-4729","publisher":"IEEE","citing_paper_count":7,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Force","Noise","Noise measurement","Observers","Robots","Velocity measurement"]}},"pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7139970","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7139970","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=7139970","authors":{"authors":[{"full_name":"Antonio Franchi","affiliation":"CNRS, LAAS, 7 avenue du colonel Roche, F-31400 Toulouse, France","author_order":1},{"full_name":"Antonio Petitti","affiliation":"Institute of Intelligent Systems for Automation, National Research Council (ISSIA-CNR), 70126 Bari, Italy","author_order":2},{"full_name":"Alessandro Rizzo","affiliation":"Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering, Brooklyn NY, 11201, USA","author_order":3}]},"conference_location":"Seattle, WA","conference_dates":"26-30 May 2015","partnum":"CFP15RAA-ART","start_page":"5517","end_page":"5522","abstract":"In this paper, a distributed approach for the estimation of kinematic and inertial parameters of an unknown rigid body is presented.

Recent results suggest that in various settings NN queries may be the computational bottleneck of such algorithms. Moreover, in several asymptotically-optimal algorithms these NN queries are of a specific form: Given a set of points and a radius r report all pairs of points whose distance is at most r. This calls for an application-specific NN data structure tailored to efficiently answering this type of queries. Randomly transformed grids (RTG) were recently proposed by Aiger et al. [1] as a tool to answer such queries in Euclidean spaces and have been shown to outperform common implementations of NN data structures for this type of queries. In this work we employ RTG for sampling-based motion-planning algorithms and describe an efficient implementation of the approach. We show that for motion planning, RTG allow for faster convergence to high-quality solutions when compared to existing NN data structures. Additionally, RTG enable significantly shorter construction times for batched-PRM variants; specifically, we demonstrate a speedup by a factor of two to three for some scenarios."},{"rank":8,"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","article_number":"7139969","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139969","title":"Supervised Remote Robot with Guided Autonomy and Teleoperation (SURROGATE): A framework for whole-body manipulation","publication_number":7128761,"publication_title":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","isbn":"New-2005_Electronic_978-1-4799-6923-4","issn":"1050-4729","publisher":"IEEE","citing_paper_count":3,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Cameras","Collision avoidance","Computational modeling","Iterative closest point algorithm","Kinematics","Planning","Robots"]}},"pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7139969","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7139969","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=7139969","authors":{"authors":[{"full_name":"Paul Hebert","affiliation":"Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA, USA","author_order":1},{"full_name":"Jeremy Ma","affiliation":"Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA, USA","author_order":2},{"full_name":"James Borders","affiliation":"Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA, USA","author_order":3},{"full_name":"Alper Aydemir","affiliation":"Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA, USA","author_order":4},{"full_name":"Max Bajracharya","affiliation":"Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA, USA","author_order":5},{"full_name":"Nicolas Hudson","affiliation":"Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA, USA","author_order":6},{"full_name":"Krishna Shankar","affiliation":"California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, USA","author_order":7},{"full_name":"Sisir Karumanchi","affiliation":"Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA, USA","author_order":8},{"full_name":"Bertrand Douillard","affiliation":"Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA, USA","author_order":9},{"full_name":"Joel Burdick","affiliation":"California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, USA","author_order":10}]},"conference_location":"Seattle, WA","conference_dates":"26-30 May 2015","partnum":"CFP15RAA-ART","start_page":"5509","end_page":"5516","abstract":"The use of the cognitive capabilties of humans to help guide the autonomy of robotics platforms in what is typically called &#x201C;supervised-autonomy&#x201D; is becoming more commonplace in robotics research.

We then learn and compare several classifiers on the Kinect v2 data using a HOG baseline, two state-of-the-art deep-learning methods, and a recent tessellation-based learning approach. Originally developed for person detection in 3D data, the latter is able to learn the best selection, location and scale of a set of simple point cloud features. We show that for gender recognition, it outperforms the other approaches for both standing and walking people while being very efficient to compute with classification rates up to 150 Hz."},{"rank":13,"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","article_number":"7139607","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139607","title":"Reachable volume RRT","publication_number":7128761,"publication_title":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","isbn":"New-2005_Electronic_978-1-4799-6923-4","issn":"1050-4729","publisher":"IEEE","citing_paper_count":3,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Couplings","End effectors","Joints","Manifolds","Measurement","Planning"]}},"pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7139607","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7139607","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=7139607","authors":{"authors":[{"full_name":"Troy McMahon","affiliation":"Parasol Lab., Dept. of Comp.

In this paper we develop the methodology to apply reachable volumes to tree-based planners such as Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRTs). In particular, we propose a reachable volume RRT called RVRRT that can solve high degree of freedom problems and problems with constraints. To do so, we develop a reachable volume stepping function, a reachable volume expand function, and a distance metric based on these operations. We also present a reachable volume local planner to ensure that local paths satisfy constraints for methods such as PRMs. We show experimentally that RVRRTs can solve constrained problems with as many as 64 degrees of freedom and unconstrained problems with as many as 134 degrees of freedom. RVRRTs can solve problems more efficiently than existing methods, requiring fewer nodes and collision detection calls. We also show that it is capable of solving difficult problems that existing methods cannot."},{"rank":14,"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","article_number":"7139968","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139968","title":"Operating an unknown drawer using an aerial manipulator","publication_number":7128761,"publication_title":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","isbn":"New-2005_Electronic_978-1-4799-6923-4","issn":"1050-4729","publisher":"IEEE","citing_paper_count":7,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Dynamics","End effectors","Force","Manipulator dynamics","Mathematical model"]}},"pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7139968","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7139968","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=7139968","authors":{"authors":[{"full_name":"Suseong Kim","affiliation":"Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Seoul National University, South Korea","author_order":1},{"full_name":"Hoseong Seo","affiliation":"Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Seoul National University, South Korea","author_order":2},{"full_name":"H.

Consider a 2D grid world, in which all obstacles and robots are unit squares, and for each actuation, robots move maximally until they collide with an obstacle or another robot. In previous work, we demonstrated components of particle computation in this world, designing obstacle configurations that implement AND and OR logic gates: by using dual-rail logic, we designed NOT, NOR, NAND, XOR, XNOR logic gates. However, we were unable to design a FAN-OUT gate, which is necessary for simulating the full range of complex interactions that are present in arbitrary digital circuits. In this work we resolve this problem by proving unit-sized robots cannot generate a FAN-OUT gate. On the positive side, we resolve the missing component with the help of 2&#x00D7;1 robots, which can create fan-out gates that produce multiple copies of the inputs. Using these gates we are able to establish the full range of computational universality as presented by complex digital circuits. As an example we connect our logic elements to produce a 3-bit counter.

The vehicle, for which the model is devised, is propelled by a discontinuous activation routine which entails the collapse of an elastic shell via cable transmission and its following passive re-inflation under the action of the elastic energy stored in the shell walls. Activation routine and thrust characterization have been determined to depend massively on the capability of the shell to elastically return to its unstrained state, hence an accurate description of the dynamics of the shell during all stages of actuation and at various degrees of deformation is essential. The model, based on a geometrically exact Cosserat theory, is validated against measurement achieved from an ad-hoc experimental apparatus, bringing evidence of its aptness at capturing the key parameters of the system. Eventually the model is employed for simulating a proper propulsion routine in water demonstrating that, upon suitable parametrization of the internal and external hydrodynamics, it can reliably be employed for the realistic quantitative characterization of the cephalopod-inspired robot."},{"rank":17,"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","article_number":"7139402","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139402","title":"Active vibration canceling of a cable-driven parallel robot in modal space","publication_number":7128761,"publication_title":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","isbn":"New-2005_Electronic_978-1-4799-6923-4","issn":"1050-4729","publisher":"IEEE","citing_paper_count":3,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Aerospace electronics","Mechanical cables","Power cables","Pulleys","Robots","Transfer functions","Vibrations"]}},"pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7139402","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7139402","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=7139402","authors":{"authors":[{"full_name":"Xavier Weber","affiliation":"ICube Laboratory, 300 bd S&#x00E9;bastien Brant - CS 10413 - F-67412 Illkirch Cedex, FRANCE","author_order":1},{"full_name":"Loic Cuvillon","affiliation":"ICube Laboratory, 300 bd S&#x00E9;bastien Brant - CS 10413 - F-67412 Illkirch Cedex, FRANCE","author_order":2},{"full_name":"Jacques Gangloff","affiliation":"ICube Laboratory, 300 bd S&#x00E9;bastien Brant - CS 10413 - F-67412 Illkirch Cedex, FRANCE","author_order":3}]},"conference_location":"Seattle, WA","conference_dates":"26-30 May 2015","partnum":"CFP15RAA-ART","start_page":"1599","end_page":"1604","abstract":"Compared to other parallel robots, cable-driven parallel robots can achieve bigger workspace, higher dynamics with lighter parts and fewer energy while being economically competitive.

With lightweight cables, the very low stiffness yields disturbing vibrations. In this paper, we address the problem of decoupled active canceling of those vibrations in the modal space. In modal space, vibrations are decomposed in orthogonal signals which allows to use simple SISO control methods to build an active vibration canceling algorithm for the end-effector. As the modal space depends on the end-effector position, better performances are achieved if the controller is tuned for the current robot position.

This paper presents and evaluates an algorithm that alternates between online place recognition and offline map maintenance with the goal of producing the best performance with a fixed map size. At the core of the algorithm is the concept of a Summary Map, a reduced map representation that includes only the landmarks that are deemed most useful for place recognition. To assign landmarks to the map, we use a scoring function that ranks the utility of each landmark and a sampling policy that selects the landmarks for each place. The Summary Map can then be used by any descriptor-based inference method for constant-complexity online place recognition. We evaluate a number of scoring functions and sampling policies and show that it is possible to build and maintain maps of a constant size and that place-recognition performance improves over multiple visits."},{"rank":21,"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","article_number":"7139606","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139606","title":"Fractal trajectories for online non-uniform aerial coverage","publication_number":7128761,"publication_title":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","isbn":"New-2005_Electronic_978-1-4799-6923-4","issn":"1050-4729","publisher":"IEEE","citing_paper_count":6,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Cameras","Fractals","Robot sensing systems","Trajectory","Vegetation"]}},"pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7139606","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7139606","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=7139606","authors":{"authors":[{"full_name":"Seyed Abbas Sadat","affiliation":"Autonomy Lab, Simon Fraser University, Canada","author_order":1},{"full_name":"Jens Wawerla","affiliation":"Autonomy Lab, Simon Fraser University, Canada","author_order":2},{"full_name":"Richard Vaughan","affiliation":"Autonomy Lab, Simon Fraser University, Canada","author_order":3}]},"conference_location":"Seattle, WA","conference_dates":"26-30 May 2015","partnum":"CFP15RAA-ART","start_page":"2971","end_page":"2976","abstract":"We propose a novel method for non-uniform terrain coverage using Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

A distributed receding horizon planner provides local control, formulated as a convex optimization problem in velocity space and incorporating constraints for both collision avoidance and shape maintenance. We demonstrate teams of mobile manipulators autonomously carrying various deformable objects."},{"rank":24,"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","article_number":"7139950","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139950","title":"Tendons, concentric tubes, and a bevel tip: Three steerable robots in one transoral lung access system","publication_number":7128761,"publication_title":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","isbn":"New-2005_Electronic_978-1-4799-6923-4","issn":"1050-4729","publisher":"IEEE","citing_paper_count":4,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Electron tubes","Lungs","Needles","Phantoms","Robots","Surgery"]}},"pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7139950","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7139950","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=7139950","authors":{"authors":[{"full_name":"Philip J.

Transoral access is preferable to traditional between-the-ribs needle insertion because it is less invasive and reduces risk of lung collapse. Yet many sites in the peripheral zones of the lung or distant from the bronchi cannot currently be accessed transorally, due to the relatively large diameter and lack of sufficient steerablity of current instrumentation. To remedy this, we propose a new robotic system that uses a tendon-actuated device (bronchoscope) as a first stage for deploying a concentric tube robot, which itself is a vehicle through which a bevel steered needle can be introduced into the soft tissue of the lung outside the bronchi. In this paper we present the various components of the system and the workflow we envision for deploying the robot to a target using image guidance. We describe initial validation experiments in which we puncture ex vivo bronchial wall tissue and also target a nodule in a phantom with an average final tip error of 0.72 mm."},{"rank":25,"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","article_number":"7139589","doi":"10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139589","title":"Simultaneous estimation of shape and motion of an asteroid for automatic navigation","publication_number":7128761,"publication_title":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","isbn":"New-2005_Electronic_978-1-4799-6923-4","issn":"1050-4729","publisher":"IEEE","citing_paper_count":1,"index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Cameras","Estimation","Mathematical model","Navigation","Noise","Shape","Space vehicles"]}},"pdf_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7139589","abstract_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7139589","html_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=7139589","authors":{"authors":[{"full_name":"Naoya Takeishi","affiliation":"Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the University of Tokyo, Japan","author_order":1},{"full_name":"Takehisa Yairi","affiliation":"Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the University of Tokyo, Japan","author_order":2},{"full_name":"Yuichi Tsuda","affiliation":"Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, Sagamihara, Japan","author_order":3},{"full_name":"Fuyuto Terui","affiliation":"Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, Sagamihara, Japan","author_order":4},{"full_name":"Naoko Ogawa","affiliation":"Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, Sagamihara, Japan","author_order":5},{"full_name":"Yuya Mimasu","affiliation":"Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, Sagamihara, Japan","author_order":6}]},"conference_location":"Seattle, WA","conference_dates":"26-30 May 2015","partnum":"CFP15RAA-ART","start_page":"2861","end_page":"2866","abstract":"In an asteroid exploration and sample return mission, accurate estimation of the shape and motion of the target asteroid is essential for selecting a touchdown site and navigating a spacecraft during touchdown operation. In this work, we present an automatic estimation method for the shape and motion of an asteroid, which is planned to be tested in future exploration missions including Japanese Hayabusa-2 [1]. Our task is to estimate the shape and rotation axis of the asteroid, as well as positions of the spacecraft from optical images. The proposed method is based on the expectation conditional-maximization (ECM) framework that consists of an auxiliary particle filter and nonlinear optimization techniques. One of our technical contributions is the estimation of the direction of rotation axis of the asteroid from monocular camera images, which are taken by the moving spacecraft. We conducted two experiments with synthetic data and an asteroid mock-up to show the validity of the proposed method and to present the numerical accuracy."}]}
